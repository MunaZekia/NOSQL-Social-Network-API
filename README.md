# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

NoSQL: Social Network API is a RESTful API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
